  Possible values:
    0 - Normal actor
    1 - The player
    2 - Enemy

  & 00000100 - Should check culling before drawing.
  & 00000400 - Is frozen

    This has a side effect for enemies where they effectively have very few iframes and take damage multiple times per attack.
  & 01000000 - Do not draw for one frame.
    This bit is automatically unset after the actor decides to not draw itself because of this bit once.
  & 04000000 - Is a boss or mini-boss (?)
