execItemGet
  argument r3 is the item ID. this simply calls the item get function for whatever that item is.

itemGetExecute
  this is a function called when a field item is picked up.
  at 800f655C it calls execItemGet
  at 800f6460 it reads the item ID.
  at 800f6480 it does a switch statement on the item ID.
  the list of destinations for the switch are at 8038ca6c.
  800f6c8c is the default, used for many items not intended to be pickups. it just calls onItem, I think? so it doesn't work for a lot of stuff.
  I would need to modify the switch statement entries in this list to get other items to work as pickups.
  here are some options for what to change the entries to:
    800F667C - used by heart containers. makes link do the "you got an item!" thing. however it also plays the heart get sound effect.
    800F6724 - makes the pickup float above your head for a second, with the sfx used for joy pendants and such. no item get text.
    800F6484 - used by all items with an ID 0x84 or greater. seems to function the same as 800F6724, no item get text.
    800F675C - one used by the small key. has the message and animation, and no heart sfx! perfect.

    Turns arrow refills into green rupees if the player doesn't own any of the three bow items.
    Turns bomb refills into green rupees if the player doesn't own the bombs item.
    Turns bait into green rupees if the player doesn't own the bait bag.
    Turns spoils into green rupees if the player doesn't own the spoils bag.

GroundCheck

  Sets the amount of damage to do to the player.
  f1 - Number of quarters of hearts to add to the player's health. Float. Should be negative to deal damage.

changeDamageProc
  This function decides how much damage the player will actually take once they've gotten hit.
  At 801108B4, it reads the amount of damage from an entity+3FFE?
  But if it's not an enemy damaging the player and instead is spikes or something, then it calculates damage in some other, hardcoded way.

CalcTgPlusDmg
  800AD850 - Stores the amount of damage for the enemy to do into an entity.
  800AD840 - It reads the amount of damage to do from r28+0x14.

dStage_changeSceneExitId(cBgS_PolyInfo &, float, unsigned long, signed char)
  Handles a stage transition specified by the Exit ID property set in the DZB collision geometry.
  There are some special exit IDs for DZB collision:
    3B - Goes into a submarine.
      Only works if this is actor collision belonging to an instance of obj_ikada, since the game reads that actor's parameters to determine which room of Beedle's shop to go to.
    3C - Goes into the Pirate Ship...?
      depends on some event bits
    3D - Returns to the sea via the last submarine or Beedle's Shop Ship exit.
      Specifically, it returns you to the room number stored to 803CA90E, and sets the spawn ID to -2.
    3E - Goes into Beedle's Shop Ship.
      Only works if this is actor collision belonging to an instance of obj_ikada, since the game reads that actor's parameters to determine which room of Beedle's shop to go to.

  event reg 89FF is related to pictures you take somehow.
  it appears to be a bitfield.
  when you erase a picture, a bit gets ORed.
  when you take a picture, the whole thing gets set to 0...?
  I guess it's doing something to preserve whatever pictographs you had in new game

bgmStart
  Starts playing background music. Boss music counts as background music.
  r4 - The BGM ID.
    BGM IDs can be a bit different from normal sound IDs.
    Normally they are the same, for example:
      80000002 - Plays BGM with index 02.
    But sometimes, the BGM ID is over 0x100, for example:
      80000130 - Plays BGM with index 42.
    These 100+ BGM IDs allow playing certain hardcoded BGMs with different instruments.
    For example, 120-123 all play Gohdan's theme (d_amosu.bms), but they sound quite different.
    How to map these special BGM IDs to BGM indexes is hardcoded into bgmStart.
    Full list:
      80000105 -> 80000005
      80000110 -> 80000014

fopAcM_entrySolidHeap(fopAc_ac_c *, int (*)(fopAc_ac_c *), unsigned long)
  Allocates some memory from the Game heap and initializes an entity.
  This function stores a pointer to the start of the memory block to [entity+0xF0].
  In order to know how much memory actually gets used, it first temporarily allocates an amount of memory from a block equal to the amount of memory specified in r5, the maximum that may be needed for this entity.
  Then it runs the callback function so the entity initializes itself, and lets it use as much of the allocated memory as it wants, and then sees how much space that used, and remarks the space in the block that WASN'T used to be free again.
  If r5 is not 0, it will give the entity the smallest free block of memory available that is large enough for the entity to use (specifically, a chunk has to be at least r5+0x90 bytes large if you don't count the 0x10 byte block header, or r5+0xA0 bytes large if you do).
  If r5 is 0, it gives the entity the largest contiguous free block of memory to work with - so it doesn't have to worry about hitting some arbitrary maximum, but on the downside this can potentially worsen memory fragmentation if the entity is one that stays loaded even when changing rooms (e.g. background island LoD models).
  if argument r5 is 0, then it seems to just allocate the entirety of the biggest block temporarily.
  r3 - Entity pointer
  r4 - Callback function for this entity to initialize itself
  r5 - Maximum amount of memory that may be needed, or 0 for no maximum.

createSolidHeapFromGameToCurrent

JKRHeap::alloc(unsigned long, int, JKRHeap *)
  Allocates some memory out of a heap.
  r3 - The amount of memory to allocate.
  r4 - Affects how the memory is allocated?
    Specifics might depend on the exact class of the heap.
    For JKRExpHeaps:
      If negative, allocate from tail. Otherwise, allocate from head.
      If the absolute value is > 4, it will be passed as argument r5 to the overloaded versions of allocFromHead/allocFromTail.
      If the absolute value is <= 4, no argument r5 will be passed, it uses the non-overloaded versions.
  r5 - Pointer to a JKRHeap (or child class)
    If this pointer is 0, it will use the current heap instead (803F772C - JKRHeap::sCurrentHeap)

fopAcIt_Judge(void *(*)(void *, void *), void *)
  This function searches through all actors that currently exist, and returns a pointer to the first one that matches some criteria, or it returns 0 if no actor does.
  r3 - Pointer to a callback function that checks whether a given actor meets the criteria or not.
    The callback function should take the following arguments:
      r3 - The actor that is currently being checked by fopAcIt_Judge.
      r4 - The pointer to some custom data that was passed as argument r4 to fopAcIt_Judge.
  r4 - A pointer to some custom data to be used to check if an actor meets the criteria or not.
  An example of a function that can be passed as r3 is fpcSch_JudgeByID(void *, void *) - refer to that for an example.

fpcSch_JudgeByID(void *, void *)
  A callback function that can be passed to fopAcIt_Judge for finding an actor that has a certain unique ID.
  r3 - The actor that is currently being checked by fopAcIt_Judge.
  r4 - A pointer to the unique ID to check for.
  For example you can do this:
    li      r0,1234            ; Unique ID to find the actor for
    stw     r0,32(r1)
    lis     r3,0x80040068@ha   ; fpcSch_JudgeByID(void *, void *)

    addi    r4,r1,32
    bl      0x80023FB4         ; fopAcIt_Judge(void *(*)(void *, void *), void *)
  The above code will get a pointer to the actor with unique ID 1234, or 0 if said actor doesn't exist.

  This function is similar to calling fopAcIt_Judge with fpcSch_JudgeByID, but there's one major difference:
  If fopAcIt_Judge can't find the actor, it will just return 0.
  If fopAcM_SearchByID can't find the actor, it will put 0 at where r4 points to, but if the actor is in the process of being asynchronously created and simply doesn't exist YET, it will still return true, not false.
  This is very useful when you need to know if the actor hasn't spawned in yet, or if it used to exist but was deleted.
