execItemGet
  argument r3 is the item ID. this simply calls the item get function for whatever that item is.

itemGetExecute
  this is a function called when a field item is picked up.
  at 800f655C it calls execItemGet
  at 800f6460 it reads the item ID.
  at 800f6480 it does a switch statement on the item ID.
  the list of destinations for the switch are at 8038ca6c.
  800f6c8c is the default, used for many items not intended to be pickups. it just calls onItem, I think? so it doesn't work for a lot of stuff.
  I would need to modify the switch statement entries in this list to get other items to work as pickups.
  here are some options for what to change the entries to:
    800F667C - used by heart containers. makes link do the "you got an item!" thing. however it also plays the heart get sound effect.
    800F6724 - makes the pickup float above your head for a second, with the sfx used for joy pendants and such. no item get text.
    800F6484 - used by all items with an ID 0x84 or greater. seems to function the same as 800F6724, no item get text.
    800F675C - one used by the small key. has the message and animation, and no heart sfx! perfect.

  f1 - Number of quarters of hearts to add to the player's health. Float. Should be negative to deal damage.

changeDamageProc
  This function decides how much damage the player will actually take once they've gotten hit.
  At 801108B4, it reads the amount of damage from an entity+3FFE?
  But if it's not an enemy damaging the player and instead is spikes or something, then it calculates damage in some other, hardcoded way.

CalcTgPlusDmg
  800AD850 - Stores the amount of damage for the enemy to do into an entity.
  800AD840 - It reads the amount of damage to do from r28+0x14.

reinit__10dSv_info_cFv
  initializes new game+
  things it does:
  * reads 0x11 event registers (the ones listed at 80375DC8) and stores them somewhere in free space (e.g. 815b0db4)
  * reads the byte at 803C4DA8 (e.g. 0x01) into r28 (overrides hero's clothes to get the hero's new clothes?)
  * copies the player's name from the old to the stack
  * reads the byte at 803C4DAE (e.g. 0x00) into r27
  * reads the byte at 803C4DAC (e.g. 0x01) into r26
  * reads the byte at 803C4DAD (e.g. 0x00) into r25
  * reads the byte at 803C4DAF (e.g. 0x01) into r24
  * reads the byte at 803C4C70 (e.g. 0x00) into r23
  * gets event register 89FF, puts the value into r22
  * initializes the save with the regular new game function
  * sets the same 0x11 event registers back to what their value was before
  * sets 5 event bits to on (the ones listed at 80375DEC)
  * sets event register C407 to 07 (lenzo related!)
  * sets treasure box opened flag 0 in stage ID B (pictobox chest!)
  * sets switch 0x47 for stage ID 0 (unsure what this is...)
  * sets switch 0x5E for stage ID 0 (unsure what this is...)
  * copies the player's old name from the stack to the new save file
  * stores r28 back to 803C4DA8
  * stores r27 back to 803C4DAE
  * stores r26 back to 803C4DAC
  * stores r25 back to 803C4DAD
  * stores r24 back to 803C4DAF
  * sets 803C4DA9, the index of the random salvage points to use, to 3
  * puts deluxe picto box in the player's inventory
  * sets byte 803CA7E5 to 8
  * sets byte 803CA7E6 to 0x26 (same as picto box ID)
  * sets the bits for owning both picto boxes
  * stores r23 back to 803C4C70
  * sets event register 89FF back to the old value (in r22)
  
  event reg 89FF is related to pictures you take somehow.
  it appears to be a bitfield.
  when you erase a picture, a bit gets ORed.
  when you take a picture, the whole thing gets set to 0...?
  I guess it's doing something to preserve whatever pictographs you had in new game

bgmStart
  Starts playing background music. Boss music counts as background music.
  r4 - The BGM ID.
    BGM IDs can be a bit different from normal sound IDs.
    Normally they are the same, for example:
      80000002 - Plays BGM with index 02.
    But sometimes, the BGM ID is over 0x100, for example:
      80000130 - Plays BGM with index 42.
    These 100+ BGM IDs allow playing certain hardcoded BGMs with different instruments.
    For example, 120-123 all play Gohdan's theme (d_amosu.bms), but they sound quite different.
    How to map these special BGM IDs to BGM indexes is hardcoded into bgmStart.
    Full list:
      80000105 -> 80000005

fopAcM_entrySolidHeap(fopAc_ac_c *, int (*)(fopAc_ac_c *), unsigned long)
  Allocates some memory from the Game heap and initializes an entity.
  This function stores a pointer to the start of the memory block to [entity+0xF0].
  In order to know how much memory actually gets used, it first temporarily allocates an amount of memory from a block equal to the amount of memory specified in r5, the maximum that may be needed for this entity.
  Then it runs the callback function so the entity initializes itself, and lets it use as much of the allocated memory as it wants, and then sees how much space that used, and remarks the space in the block that WASN'T used to be free again.
  If r5 is not 0, it will give the entity the smallest free block of memory available that is large enough for the entity to use (specifically, a chunk has to be at least r5+0x90 bytes large if you don't count the 0x10 byte block header, or r5+0xA0 bytes large if you do).
  If r5 is 0, it gives the entity the largest contiguous free block of memory to work with - so it doesn't have to worry about hitting some arbitrary maximum, but on the downside this can potentially worsen memory fragmentation if the entity is one that stays loaded even when changing rooms (e.g. background island LoD models).
  if argument r5 is 0, then it seems to just allocate the entirety of the biggest block temporarily.
  r3 - Entity pointer
  r4 - Callback function for this entity to initialize itself
  r5 - Maximum amount of memory that may be needed, or 0 for no maximum.

JKRHeap::alloc(unsigned long, int, JKRHeap *)
  Allocates some memory out of a heap.
  r3 - The amount of memory to allocate.
  r4 - Affects how the memory is allocated?
    Specifics might depend on the exact class of the heap.
    For JKRExpHeaps:
      If negative, allocate from tail. Otherwise, allocate from head.
      If the absolute value is > 4, it will be passed as argument r5 to the overloaded versions of allocFromHead/allocFromTail.

fopAcIt_Judge(void *(*)(void *, void *), void *)
  This function searches through all actors that currently exist, and returns a pointer to the first one that matches some criteria, or it returns 0 if no actor does.
  r3 - Pointer to a callback function that checks whether a given actor meets the criteria or not.
    The callback function should take the following arguments:
      r3 - The actor that is currently being checked by fopAcIt_Judge.
      r4 - The pointer to some custom data that was passed as argument r4 to fopAcIt_Judge.
  r4 - A pointer to some custom data to be used to check if an actor meets the criteria or not.
  An example of a function that can be passed as r3 is fpcSch_JudgeByID(void *, void *) - refer to that for an example.

fpcSch_JudgeByID(void *, void *)
  A callback function that can be passed to fopAcIt_Judge for checking if an actor has a certain unique ID.
  r3 - The actor that is currently being checked by fopAcIt_Judge.
  r4 - A pointer to the unique ID to check for.
  For example you can do this:
    li      r0,1234            ; Unique ID to find the actor for
    stw     r0,32(r1)
    lis     r3,0x80040068@ha   ; fpcSch_JudgeByID(void *, void *)
    addi    r3,r3,0x80040068@l ; fpcSch_JudgeByID(void *, void *)
    addi    r4,r1,32
    bl      0x80023FB4         ; fopAcIt_Judge(void *(*)(void *, void *), void *)
  The above code will get a pointer to the actor with unique ID 1234, or 0 if said actor doesn't exist.

fopAcM_SearchByID(unsigned int, fopAc_ac_c **)
  This function checks if an actor with a given unique ID currently exists or not.
  r3 - The unique ID to check for.
  r4 - A pointer to where to store the pointer to the actor.
  This function returns r3 - a boolean for whether the actor exists or not.
  This function is similar to calling fopAcIt_Judge with fpcSch_JudgeByID, but there's one major difference:
  If fopAcIt_Judge can't find the actor, it will just return 0.
  If fopAcM_SearchByID can't find the actor, it will put 0 at where r4 points to, but if the actor is in the process of being asynchronously created and simply doesn't exist YET, it will still return true, not false.
  This is very useful when you need to know if the actor hasn't spawned in yet, or if it used to exist but was deleted.
