This file documents the format of various types of entities with .dzr and .dzs files.
For entities that have parameters, it also documents their parameters and the corresponding bitmasks for them.

### STAG:
  04,4: ? Read in func drawVrKumo. float
  09,1:
    0x01 - Whether this stage is a dungeon (note that the dungeon boss stage doesn't count as a dungeon).
    0xFE - The stage ID.
      The stage's save info can be found in list 0x803C4F88. The stage ID is the index in that list.
  0A,2:
    0x0003 - Affects the type of map you get when you press up on the D-pad.
      0 - Sea chart.
      1 - Dungeon map.
      2 - No map?
      3 - No map?
    0x0004 - ???
    0x07F8 - Particle bank ID to load for this stage.
      The filename of the particle bank to load is:
      "files/res/Particle/Pscene%03d.jpc" % particle_bank_id
    0xF800 - ???
  0C,4:
    0x000000FF - ? Read in func SetSchBit
    0x00070000 - Stage type? Read in funcs drawSun, setGameStartStage, and checkRoofRestart
      1 - Dungeon
      3 - Boss
      If this value is equal to 3, solid objects falling on the player do not cause the room to restart?
  10,4:
    0x00FF0000 - ? Read in func SetSchBit

### RTBL:
  RTBL (Room TaBLe) is responsible for loading in rooms when in a given part of a room. RTBL chunks appear in the stage.dzs file.
  Which RTBL entry to use is determined by the collision group below the player. Collision groups have an RTBL index in their data to handle this. (The index can be FF for no RTBL entry in that location.)
  For example, on the sea stage, each of the 50 rooms has its own unique entry in the sea stage's RTBL list. Outset for example has an RTBL entry specifying that both room 0 and room 44 (Outset itself) should be loaded. In the sea, room 0's role is to always be loaded regardless of which sector you're in. Room 0 has collision through the whole sea floor, a different group for each sector. Because this collision groups have different RTBL indexes set for each sector, room 0's collision on the sea floor causes different RTBL entries to be used when the player crosses over sector borders. This is what handles loading and unloading rooms on the sea.
  Note that while in many cases (like the sea) the room number and the RTBL index will happen to be the same because each room only has one RTBL entry, this is not always the case. For example, the hub room in DRC has three different RTBL entries depending on what part of it you're in, because you can be near the doors to many different rooms in the hub room.
  Main entry format:
    00,4: Offset within this dzs file to this entry's subentry.
  Sub entry format:
    00,1: Number of rooms in this entry's rooms list.
    01,1: "Reverb amount"
    02,1: Boolean(?) for whether time should pass here.
    03,1: ???
    04,4: Offset within this dzs file to this entry's rooms list.
  Rooms list:
    Each room takes up 1 byte:
    & 80 - room should be visible...?
      If set, both bits & 02 and & 08 in 104,1 bitfield in this room's zone data will be set on. If not set, only bit & 02 will be set there.
      loadRoom__20dStage_roomControl_cFiPUc is the function that handles setting those bits like this.
    & 40 - ?
      all the sea rooms have room 0 constantly loaded, and this bit is set for room 0 being there.
      guess it loads the collision?
    & 3F - Room number of this room.
    Note about which bits to set:
      For dungeons it seems like both bits 80 and 40 should be set for the current room (the one that owns this RTBL entry), while for non-current rooms neither bit should be set.
      For the sea, it seems like room 0 should always have both bits 80 and 40 set, while whatever the room for the current sector is should have bit 80 set but not bit 40.
      Perhaps bit 80 means the room's collision and entities should be loaded, while bit 40 means it's the "active" room...?

### 2DMA:
  36,1: Determines which island the player will be placed on when save and quitting.
    0x0F - X coordinate of the island's sector.
    0xF0 - Y coordinate of the island's sector.
      The X and Y can both range from -3 to +3.
      0,0 refers to the center of the map (the sector with Six-Eye Reef).
      Positive X means right relative to the center, positive Y means down relative to the center.

    6 - Chest is invisible, but there is a triforce emblem on the ground below it. The chest will appear once a certain switch is set.
    7 - Consider this chest's open flag to be in stage ID 1 instead of the actual stage ID of the current stage.

      If this value is anything other than 2, 3, or 4, this becomes a noncyclic warp pot instead (see below).
    Gets stored to entity+0x2B4,4
  params & 0x000000F0 - Which event register of unlocked warp jars to use.
    Index in list 2DC0 (entry length 2).

      2 - A007 (Unused)
      3 - 9F07 (WT)
      4 - A307 (ET)
      5 - A407 (Unused)
    Gets stored to entity+0x2B8,4

    If this is FF, the thing blocking the top will be a normal lid that is part of the pot actor.
    If this is any other value, you will need to place a separate actor on top of the warp pot that sets the relevant switch when it's destroyed. The pot itself will have no lid - so the player can actually use it if you don't block the top properly, despite the warp pot thinking it should be locked. Note that because it thinks it's locked, the smoke particle coming from the pot will seethe outwards instead of upwards.
  aux_params & 0xFF00 - Unused for cyclic warp pots.
  aux_params_2 & 0x00FF - If this is 0xFF, the warp pot will play a sound effect when unlocked. Otherwise it won't.

      1 - Noncyclic warp pot that is unlocked (Warpnt).
    If this value is 2, 3, or 4, this becomes a regular warp pot instead (see above).
    Gets stored to entity+0x2B4,4
  params & 0x00000FF0 - Seems to be an unused SCLS index that points to the spawn coming out of this warp pot.
    Gets stored to entity+298,4
  params & 0x000FF000 - Where to warp when successfully going into this warp pot.
    This is an SCLS exit index in this room's SCLS list.
    Gets stored to entity+29C,4
  aux_params & 0x00FF - Switch index for this warp pot being opened.
    For unlocked pots (type 1), this switch is set by default when the warp pot is created.
    Gets stored to entity+2AC,4
  aux_params & 0xFF00 - Switch index for the other warp pot connected to this one being opened.
    Gets stored to entity+2B0,4
  aux_params_2 - Unused for noncyclic warp pots.
  Example params:
    Unlocked lower warp pot in puppet ganon's room:
      params: 000 02 03 1
      aux_params: 08 07
      aux_params_2: 0000
    Locked upper warp pot in puppet ganon's room:

      aux_params: 07 08
      aux_params_2: 0000
wiz_r: Wizzrobe. (d_a_wz)
  params & 0x000000FF - Behavior type.
    00 - Shoots fireballs.
    01 - Spawns enemies and shoots fireballs.
    02 - Mini-boss Wizzrobe.
      Behaves similar to type 1.
    03 - ?
      Behaves similar to type 0.
    0A - Fireball?
    0C - Spawner orb? white orb that actually spawns the enemies
    0D - Spawner orb? white orb that actually spawns the enemies
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
  params & 0x0000FF00 - Disable spawn on death switch.
  params & 0x00FF0000 - Enable spawn switch.
  params & 0xFF000000 - Path index for the Wizzrobe to appear on.
    The Wizzrobe seems to teleport to random points on the path.
    For type 0 Wizzrobes, this can be FF for no path, and it will just repeatedly teleport around its initial position.
    But for type 1 Wizzrobes, having no path will crash the game.
    For type 1 Wizzrobes, this path must also have a "next path"/"AssociatedPathIndex" specified, and that next path's two points will be used as the positions to spawn the two enemies this Wizzrobe creates.
    If there is no next path, type 1 Wizzrobes will crash the game.
  aux_params_2 & 00FF - Which enemy summon table to use.
    If this is FF, it defaults to 00.
    The list of possible enemy actor IDs to summon is enemy_name_dt$6153.
    This parameter determines which of the possible spawn tables within that list to use. Each table is 0x10 bytes long.
    Each table has 4 entries in it. The Wizzrobe seems to select which of the 4 to start on randomly, and then cycles through them in order?
    Each entry is composed of 2 halfwords. The first halfword is the first enemy actor ID to spawn. The second halfword is either the second enemy actor ID to spawn, or 0x7FFF for no second enemy.
    The parameters of each enemy to spawn is in list enemy_arg_dt$6154. Each entry in this list is composed of 2 words instead of 2 halfwords, but other than that you access entries the same as above (first use the summon table index parameter, then the random entry index).
    The number of each enemy to spawn at once is in list birth_dt$6155. Works the same as above.
Homen1, Homen2: Stone head with a hookshot target on it. (d_a_obj_homen)
  params & 0x0000007F - Item pickup flag for the item inside it.
  params & 0x00000F00 - Type.
    0 - Large stone head. (Homen1)
    1 - Small stone head. (Homen2)
  params & 0x0003F000 - Affects the item spawned? Like what item table it chooses from?
  params & 0x003C0000 - Might affect what enemy is spawned when you remove this statue from the wall?
    2 - Bokoblin?
    3 - ?
    F - No enemy
  params & 0xFF000000 - Switch index for ?
  Example params (the 4 from that tall basement room in Wind Temple where you need to kill all enemies):
  980BF105
  993CA17F

  9B0FF106
c_green, c_red, c_blue, c_black, c_kiiro: ChuChu. (d_a_cc)
  params & 0x000000FF - Behavior type.
    00 - Normal.
    01 - Falls from the ceiling.
    02 - ChuChu never spawns in properly.
      It's impossible to see or kill, but still counts as alive so it will prevent you from completing the room.
    03 - Does not attack Link, just moves around randomly.
      This behavior type is intended for Blu ChuChus. It causes Grappling Hook to not steal Chu Jelly from them, and Hookshot to not pull them to Link (only makes it stand up if in a puddle).
    04 - Hiding in a pot.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
    If the value located at 803E75A8,2 is not 0, this value will be forcibly changed to 03.
  params & 0x0000FF00 - Type of ChuChu.
     0 - Green
     1 - Red
     2 - Blue
     3 - Dark
     4 - Yellow
     A - Switches itself to 0 (Green), and overrides its range with 60000.0.
     B - Switches itself to 1 (Red), and overrides its range with 60000.0.
     C - Switches itself to 2 (Blue), and overrides its range with 60000.0.
     D - Switches itself to 3 (Dark), and overrides its range with 60000.0.
     E - Switches itself to 4 (Yellow), and overrides its range with 60000.0.
     F - Switches itself to 1 (Red), overrides its range with 60000.0, and also makes it vulnerable to dying from things it normally wouldn't like Hookshot, Boomerang, and Grappling Hook.
     The purpose of the duplicate A-E types is for Wizzrobe spawning - most of the ChuChus spawned by Wizzrobes have their type randomly selected (Green, Red, Yellow, MAYBE Dark??), but ones with the A-E type specified will always spawn as that type, with no randomness.
  params & 0x00FF0000 - This number multiplied by 10.0 is used as a range within it notices the player.
    00 or FF:
      If behavior type is 1, these default to a range of 1200.0.
      If behavior type is 4, these do not default to anything, and actually use 0 or 255*10.0 as the range. Though I'm not sure if the range actually affects how type 4s act anyway?
      If behavior type is anything else, these default to a range of 1000.0.
  params & 0xFF000000 - Disable spawn switch.
    TODO: how does this work for blue chuchus...?
  Example params:
  0B1E0203 - Blue ChuChu on Eastern Fairy Island.
  FFFF04FF - Yellow ChuChu in first room of TotG.
  C0FF0001 - Green ChuChu in WT.
  FF500101 - Red ChuChu in DRC.

Hhbot1N: Heavy switch you must depress with the iron boots. (d_a_obj_swheavy)
  params & 07000000 - Type maybe?
  params & 0000FF00 - Switch index to set when depressed.
  Example params:
  03013200 - Tall Basement Room in Wind Temple
gmos, gmos_g, gmos_f: Mothulas. (d_a_gm)
  params & 000000FF - Which wings this Mothula starts out already missing. Bitfield.
    & 01 - Missing lower right wing.
    & 02 - Missing lower left wing.
    & 04 - Missing upper right wing.
    & 08 - Missing upper left wing.
    FF - Defaults to 00 (not missing any wings).
    If this is a wingless Mothula type, it automatically sets this to 0F so it's missing all wings.
    If this is a winged Mothula type, and you manually set this to 0F so it's missing all wings, it bugs out. Instead of becoming a wingless Mothula type, it will fly with no wings, and also be immune to all damage (not counting being shattered with Ice Arrows or killed with Light Arrows).
    If this is a wing instead of an actual Mothula (i.e. wing type is 1 or 2), then this params & 000000FF is instead an int from 01-04 for which wing it is:
      01 - Lower right wing.
      02 - Lower left wing.
      03 - Upper right wing.
      04 - Upper left wing.
  params & 0000FF00 - Wing type.
    00 - Not a wing, this is actually a Mothula.
    01 - Wing that falls down while spinning.
    02 - Wing that floats down gently.
    FF - Defaults to 00.
  params & 00FF0000 - Type.
    00 - Mini-boss Winged Mothula.
    01 - Wingless Mothula.
    02 - Common enemy Winged Mothula.
    FF - Same as 00.
    Read at 8030 in func daGM_Create(fopAc_ac_c *)
  params & FF000000 - Disable spawn on death switch.
    FF - Invalid.
  aux_params_2 & 00FF - If 00, do not set switch at params & FF000000, even if it is valid.
Hmos1, Hmos2, Hmos3: Beamos and laser barriers. (d_a_obj_bemos)
  params & 000000FF - Varies depending on the type of Beamos.
    For Red and Blue Beamos: This number multiplied by 100.0 plus 500.0 is the range within it will notice the player and start firing its laser.
      Note that values here larger than 5 or so won't work as expected. The Beamos might notice you at higher ranges but it will wind up firing its laser into the floor, or trying to fire it at you but the laser is too short and is cut off.
      FF - Defaults to a range of 500.0 instead.
    For laser forcefields: Deactivation switch index.
      When this switch is set the lasers will stop firing.
      FF - Invalid.
  params & 0000FF00 - Varies depending on whether this is a Red Beamos or a laser barrier. (No effect on Blue Beamos.)
    For Red Beamos: This is the speed the head turns at, and whether it's clockwise or counterclockwise.
      Signed byte.
      If positive or zero: turn_speed = this*250 + 750
      If negative: turn_speed = this*250 - 750
      (Note: 0x4000 or 16384 turn speed is equal to 90 degrees per frame.)
      Examples:
        00 - 750
        01 - 1000
        03 - 1500
        05 - 2000
        FD - -1500
    For laser barriers:
      00 - Normal.
      01 - Lasers only appear if the active Servant of the Tower is in the same room as this.
      02 - Lasers have no solid collision. The player can walk through them if they just took damage and have iframes.
      FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
  params & 00FF0000 - Path index for the laser barrier's laser to follow.
    One end of the barrier will be at one point, the other end at the other point.
    No effect on actual Beamos types.
    If this is not a valid path index and this is a laser barrier type, then it will just be half of the laser barrier (one of the wall decorations + one laser).
  params & F0000000 - Type.
    0 - Blue Beamos. Always fires at a specific spot. (Hmos1)
    1 - Red Beamos. Tracks you. (Hmos2)
    2 - Laser barrier. (Hmos3)
  aux_params_2 & 003F - Affects what item it drops when the eye is destroyed. (Red and Blue Beamos only.)
    This is argument r4 to createItemFromTable.
  aux_params_2 & 1FC0 - Item pickup flag to give to the item it drops when the eye is destroyed. (Red and Blue Beamos only.)
    7F - No permanent pickup flag, the Beamos will drop this item every time its eye is destroyed.
  If this is a single laser (type is laser barrier and path index is invalid), then it has these paremeters:
    aux_params_1 & FFFF - X rotation.

    0xF - Means don't check any triforce chart. Appear regardless.
  params & 0000F000 - Random duplicate ID of this ship.
    0-3, this is the same number that salvages use (at 803C4DA9).
    0xF - Means no duplicate ID, this ship just always appears regardless of random salvage placement.
  params & 00FF0000 - 
  params & FF000000 - 
  aux_params & 0x00FF - Switch index to check and not have this gunboat appear unless the switch is already set.

  params & 0000003F - 
  params & 000000C0 - Type?
    0 - Outside either Fire Mountain or Ice Ring Isle
    1 - Inside Fire Mountain

  params & 0x0000FF00 - ?
  params & 0x00010000 - ?
  params & 0x00F00000 - ? Affects whether it disappears after Endless Night is over or not maybe?
Stoudai: Lighthouse. (d_a_obj_light)
  params: None.
Figure: A figurine in the Nintendo Gallery. (d_a_obj_figure)
  params & 0x000000FF - Figurine ID.
    This is the index in the figurine data table (l_figure_dat_tbl of d_a_obj_figure).
    Also, if you add this to decimal 14301 (0x37DD) you get the message ID of the message to display when the player examines this figurine.
Ocanon: Wall-mounted cannon. (d_a_obj_canon)
  params & 0x000000FF - 
  params & 0x0000FF00 - Switch index to check and not have this cannon appear unless the switch is already set.
  params & 0x00FF0000 - a room path index...?
  params & 0xFF000000 - Switch index to set when destroyed.
kusax1, kusax7, kusax21, flower, flwr7, flwr17, pflower, pflwrx7, swood, swood3, swood5, Grass: Vegetation. (d_a_grass)
  params & 0x0000000F - ? possibly subtype
    Index in list l_offsetData$4090 (entry length 8).
    For example, kusax1 vs kusax7 or swood3 vs swood5 seem to have different values for this.
  params & 0x00000030 - Type.
    0 - Grass (kusa)
    1 - Tree (swood)
    2 - White Flower (flower)
    3 - Pink Flower (pflower)
  params & 0x00000FC0 - Affects what item(s) to spawn.
    Valid values appear to be 0x20 to 0x3F. Other values seem to default to -1 (no item) instead.
    This parameter gets passed as argument r4 to createItemFromTable when the object is cut down.
    Subtract 0x20 from this parameter to get the index in the random item table. https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/tww/ItemTable.bin
Puti: Miniblin. (d_a_pt)
  params & 0x0000000F - Type.
    0 - Respawning Miniblin.
    1 - Single Miniblin.
    F - Single Miniblin.
  params & 0x00000010 - Initial spawn type.
    0 - The Miniblin is spawned from the start, even if it's in view of the player's camera.
      For respawning Miniblins, only the first one when you enter the room is spawned like this - respawned ones will still not spawn if in view of the player's camera.
    1 - Only spawns when the player's camera is turned away from its spawn point.
  params & 0x000000E0 - Controls the delay between the Miniblin respawning.
    00-06 - The delay before respawning the Miniblin after the last one dies is (this_value*0x14)+0x14 frames.
    07 - Use the initial spawn delay (from aux_params & FFFF) as the respawn delay too.
    Read at 4988 in func daPt_Create(fopAc_ac_c *)
  params & 0x0000FF00 - This number multiplied by 100.0 is the range within it will notice you and become active.
    00 and FF do not default to anything.
    Miniblins that haven't activated yet are invincible - so Miniblins with a range of 00 can never be killed for example.
  params & 0x00FF0000 - Disable respawning switch / set on non-respawning death switch.
    Once something sets this switch, respawning Miniblins will not respawn anymore.
    If this switch index is a valid permanent switch and this is NOT a respawning Miniblin but a single one, it doesn't work properly.
    The single Miniblin is coded to set this switch when it dies unlike the respawning Miniblin, but this switch being set doesn't disable its spawn when you exit and re-enter the room. So the single Miniblin just winds up being permanently deactivated and unkillable (and may be invisible too depending on params & 0x00000010).
    But if you use a temporary switch here instead of a permanent mem bit, you can use this just fine to have the single Miniblin set it when it dies to activate something else.
  params & 0xFF000000 - Enable spawn switch.
    But there's also some weird case where it will set this switch itself...? If some static variable at 6146 in the rel is nonzero? Not sure if that behavior is actually used.
    Read at 49D0 in func daPt_Create(fopAc_ac_c *)
  aux_params & FFFF - Initial spawn delay.
    This is the number of frames after the player enters the room before the first Miniblin will spawn.
    Note that if the initial spawn type is set to spawned from the start, the Miniblin will be visible but inactive and invincible until this initial spawn delay is up.
  Example params (shark island):
    FF82FFFF
    FF81FFFF
    FF80FFFF
    8588FFFF
    878AFFFF
    809BFFF0
    898CFFFF
    8E91FFFF
    829DFFF0
    9497FFFF
    9396FFFF
BigElf: Great Fairy. (d_a_bigelf)
  params & 0x000000FF - Type. Which specific Great Fairy this is.

Zl1: Tetra. (d_a_npc_zl1)
  params & 000000FF - Type?
p_zelda: Princess Zelda. (d_a_pz)
  params & 0000FF00 - ?
    0xFF here defaults to 0 instead.
    Seems to be a boolean
pow: Poe. (d_a_pw)
  params & 0x000000FF - Type.
    00 - The Poe and its lantern are both visible from the start. The Poe starts wandering around on its own even before it notices the player.
    01 - Both the Poe and its lantern are invisible at first, but become visible when the player gets close.
    02 - At first the Poe is invisible but the lantern is visible. The Poe becomes visible when the player gets close.
    03 - Jalhalla spawned Poe.
    04 - Jalhalla spawned Poe.
      Types 03 and 04 do not appear when placed in a level, they need to be created by fopAcM_createChild so they have have Jalhalla's entity ID available as their parent ID.
      Also, I'm not sure how 03 and 04 are different from each other.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
    If the value located at 803E75AA,2 is not 0, this value will be forcibly changed to (value at 803E75AA,2 minus 1).
  params & 0x00000100 - How it floats.
    0 - Will float down from its initial Y pos to the Y pos of the floor below it.
      This type is never placed ingame. Jalhalla technically uses it for the Poes he spawns, but it doesn't seem to have any effect on them since they're never in their floating state.
    1 - Will hover at its initial Y pos and not come down.
    This bit is always set for placed Poes, but never for Poes spawned by Jalhalla.
  params & 0x0000FE00 - Color.
    0 - Blue
    1 - Purple
    2 - Orange
    3 - Yellow
    4 - Red
    5 - Green
    6+ - Defaults to 0 instead.
  params & 0x00FF0000 - For type 2, this number multiplied by 10.0 is used as the range within the Poe will notice the player and materialize.
    FF - Defaults to a range of 1000.0 (instead of 255*10.0).
  params & 0xFF000000 - Path index to follow.
    Can be FF for none.
  The Poes created by Jalhalla have the following params:
    FF000003
    FF000004
    Except the color param, which is a random number from 0-4 for the first Poe spawned, and then increases by 1 for each Poe after, looping back to 0 after it goes past 5.
big_pow: Jalhalla. (d_a_bpw)
  params & 0x000000FF - Type.
    00 - Jalhalla.
    01 - Jalhalla's lantern.
    02 - Jalhalla's flame breath.

    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
  params & 0x00FF0000 - Switch index?
    Jalhalla sets this switch, this switch +1, and this switch +2 in light_on_off.
  aux_params_1 & FFFF - X rotation.
  aux_params_2 & FFFF - Z rotation.
Ls1: Aryll. (d_a_npc_ls1)
  params & 0x000000FF - Type.
    00 - On her lookout, after you have Hero's Clothes
    01 - In FF1 tower

p_hat, sea_hat: Peahats and Seahats.
  params & 0x000000FF - Type.
    00 - Peahat.
    01 - Seahat.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
    If the value located at 803E75AA,2 is not 0, this value will be forcibly changed to 01.
  params & 0x0000FF00 - This number multiplied by 100.0 is the horizontal range within it will notice you (radius of the cylinder).
    FF - Defaults to range of 1000.0 if this is a Peahat, or 12000.0 if this is a Seahat.
  params & 0x00FF0000 - This number multiplied by 100.0 is the vertical range within it will notice you (half the height of the cylinder).
    FF - Defaults to range of 500.0 if this is a Peahat, or 6000.0 if this is a Seahat.
bable: Red Bubbles and Blue Bubbles. (d_a_bl)
  params & 000000FF - Type.
    00 - Red Bubble
    01 - Blue Bubble
    02 - Red Bubble that follows a path
    03 - Blue Bubble that follows a path
    80 - Just an inanimate, destructible skull. Used in the Jalhalla fight.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
    If the value located at 803E75AA,2 is not 0, this value will be forcibly changed to (value at 803E75AA,2 minus 1).
  params & 0000FF00 - Enable spawn switch index.
  params & 00FF0000 - Path index to follow.
  params & FF000000 - Boolean for whether this Bubble should stay high in the air.
    00 - Will teleport itself down to the ground when spawned and float near there.
    01 - Will float around the Y position it's placed at.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
    If the value located at 803E75A8,2 is not 0, this value will be forcibly changed to 01.
kuro_s, kuro_t: Morths. (d_a_ks)
  params & 000000FF - Behavior type.
    00 - Group of Morths that chase the player when the player moves.
    01 - Group of Morths that stays in place. (kuro_t)
      Ones that the player touches and then shakes off will then chase the player.
    02 - Single Morth that stays in place.
      Ones that the player touches and then shakes off will then chase the player.
    03 - Single Morth that chases the player when the player moves.
    04 - ? Don't seem to appear when placed? Unused ingame?
    05 - ? Don't seem to appear when placed? Unused ingame?
    06 - Morths in a pot.
    FF - Defaults to 00.
    Read at 3680 in func daKS_Create(fopAc_ac_c *)
  params & 0000FF00 - Number of Morths to spawn.
    00 - Defaults to 01.
    16+ - Defaults to 01.
  params & 00FF0000 - This number multiplied by 10.0 is the range around the pot that they will look for Link within and break out of the pot if they see him.
    No effect on types besides 6.
    FF - Defaults to 00.
nezumi: Rats and Bombchus. (d_a_nz)
  params & 000000FF - ??? I can't notice any effect this has ingame, but the code suggests that it's doing something.
    00 - ? (most placed in the vanilla game use this)
    01-FE - 
      02 is the only value in this range actually used ingame, and even then it's only used once.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
    If this is zero, and this is not a Bombchu, skip some code that relates to several things, including setting scale to 0...?
    Read at 82FC in func daNZ_Create(fopAc_ac_c *)
  params & 0000FF00 - Type.
    00 - Rat
    01 - Bombchu
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
  params & FF000000 - Unused.
    This might have been intended to be a path index for the rat to follow, since the rat hole entity copies its params & FF000000 to the params & FF000000 of its spawned rats, and the rat hole's params & FF000000 appear to be a path index. But it doesn't actually do anything.
nezuana: Hole that Rats or Bombchus come out of. (d_a_nzg)
  params & 000000FF - This number multiplied by 10.0 multiplied by 0.5 is the range within it will check for the player and start spawning entities.
  params & 0000FF00 - Maximum number of entities it can spawn.
    00 - Defaults to 01 instead.
  params & 00FF0000 - Type.
    00 - Spawns Rats. Also spawns the Rat Shopkeeper that sells you things if you give it All-Purpose Bait.
    01 - Spawns Bombchus.
    02 - Spawns Rats and Bombchus.
      It's a random 50% chance what each one will come out as.
    03+ - Defaults to 00 instead.
  params & FF000000 - Unused.
    This seems like it was supposed to be a path index for something, maybe the path for its spawned entities to follow. But it doesn't actually do anything.
  It gives the entities it creates the following params:
    params & 000000FF - 01.
    params & 0000FF00 - 00 for normal Rats, 01 for Bombchus.
    params & FF000000 - Copied from this hole's params & FF000000.
Fire, Zenfire: Ring of flames that prevents you from accessing something in the center of it. (d_a_fire)
  params & 000000FF - Switch index to check.
    If this is FF, and type is 0, change type to 2. The purpose of doing this might just be a way of avoiding the code that runs every frame for type 0 that checks if the switch is set yet, since there is no switch in this case?
  params & 00000F00 - 
  params & 0001F000 - 
  params & 000E0000 - Type.
    0 - Fire that disappears when a switch is set. (Fire)
    1 - Fire that disappears when all enemies in the room are dead, like in Savage Labyrinth. (Zenfire)
    2 - Fire that disappears after a switch is set.
      Unlike type 0, this type does not disappear immediately if the switch is set when you are in the same room as the fire. The fire will simply not be there the next time the room is loaded.
  params & 00F00000 - 
Fmaster, Fmastr1, Fmastr2: Floormasters. (d_a_fm)
  params & 000000FF - Where to take Link when he is captured.
    Exit index in this room's SCLS list.
    If this is FF, it will instead just take Link to the spawn with ID 0 in the current room.
  params & 00000300 - Type.
    0 - Not a fightable Floormaster. Black hole that appears briefly under Link after he is sent back to the beginning of a dungeon. (Fmaster)
      Note that type 0 behaves differently if it has a valid prerequisite switch index (params & FF000000) specified, and that switch is turned on after the Floormaster is already spawned in. In this case, it triggers an unused behavior where the Floormaster follows underneath Link while submerged in the floor. This can be seen in test room KATA_RM/Room21.
    1 - Moves along a path. (Fmastr1)
    2 - Does not move along a path. (Fmastr2)
    3 - Defaults to 0 instead.
    (There may be more differences between Fmastr1 and Fmastr2 - they might drop different items when killed?)
  params & 00000C00 - Targeting behavior type.
    0 - Prioritizes targeting Medli or Makar if either of them are present, but will target Link if they are not.
    1 - Targets Link, but does not target Medli or Makar.
    2 - Targets Medli and Makar, but does not target Link. (Will still pull Link in if he stands on it for too long.)
    3 - Defaults to 0 instead.
  params & 00FF0000 - Path index to follow (for type 1).
  params & FF000000 - Switch index to check and not appear until it is set.
    If this is FF the Floormaster will appear from the start.
  When the game engine spawns a Floormaster under Link after he is sent back to the beginning of a dungeon, the whole params field is set to 0.
  aux_params_1 & 00FF - Switch index that, once it's set, this Floormaster will not appear anymore.
  aux_params_1 & FF00 - Where to take Medli/Makar when they are captured.
    Exit index in this stage's SCLS list.
    (Note that this works different from the exit index param for capturing the player - that's in the room's exit list, this is in the stage's list.)
    This is argument r4 to setPointRestart.
  aux_params_2 & 00FF - This number multiplied by 100.0 is the range within it will notice you.
    00 or FF - Defaults to range of 3000.0.
Bb: Kargarocs. (d_a_bb)
  params & 000000FF - Behavior type.
    00 - Flying around.
    01 - Flying around.
    02 - Flying around.
    03 - Immediately targets the player.
    04 - Sits in place.
    05 - Carries a Moblin, flying around.
    06 - Carries a Bokoblin, flying around.
    07 - Sits in place.
    FF - Flying around.
  params & 0000FF00 - This number multiplied by 100.0 is the range within it will notice you.
    FF - Defaults to range of 1500.0 (instead of 255*100.0).
  params & 00FF0000 - Path index to follow, or FF for none.
    If a path is set, this prevents it from sitting in place even if its behavior type is set to do so.
    If the path it's following has a next path defined, it seems the Kargaroc will move to the next path once it reaches the end of this path.
  params & FF000000 - Switch index that must be set before this Kargaroc appears.
    FF - This Kargaroc appears from the start.
  aux_params_2 & 00FF - Disable spawn switch index. The Kargaroc will permanently disappear once something sets this switch.
    00 - This Kargaroc never permanently disappears.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
magtail: Magtails. (d_a_mt)
  params & 000000FF - 
    00-09 - Normal?
    0A-FE - Ignores player??
    If even, ???
    If odd, ???
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
    Read at 860C in func daMt_Create(fopAc_ac_c *)
  params & 00007F00 - Which movement pattern to use? Might only be for types 0A+?
    00-0D - ?
    0E+ - ?
    Read at 8628 in func daMt_Create(fopAc_ac_c *)
  params & 00008000 - Type.
    0 - Single Magtail.
      If the switch at aux_params_2 & 00FF is not 00 or FF, it will act as a disable spawn on death switch. The Magtail sets it when it dies and won't spawn when it's set.
    1 - Can act as a Magtail spawner.
      If the switch at aux_params_2 & 00FF is not 00, and is also not set, this will respawn Magtails one at a time at the placed position when you kill the last one.
      If the switch at aux_params_2 & 00FF is 00, or it's not 00 but it's set, it acts as a single Magtail that doesn't respawn. (It doesn't set the switch when you kill them though.)
  params & 00FF0000 - Path index to follow.
    FF - No path.
    Read at 8640 in func daMt_Create(fopAc_ac_c *)
  params & FF000000 - Enable spawn switch index.
    If set while in the same room as the Magtail, the Magtail will suddenly pop into existence.
    FF - Invalid.
    Read at 864C in func daMt_Create(fopAc_ac_c *)
  aux_params_2 & 00FF - Disable spawn on death switch index.

amos: Armos Knights. (d_a_am)
  params & 000000FF - Behavior type.
    00 - Normal. Follows Link as far as it needs to and does not return to its spawn point.
    01 - Has a fixed range around its spawn point that it stays in and guards.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
    (Note that only the lowest bit actually matters, so all even numbers act as type 00 and all odd numbers except FF act as type 01.)
    If the value located at 803E75AA,2 is not 0, this value will be forcibly changed to 01.
  params & 0000FF00 - For type 01, this number multiplied by 10.0 is the radius of the area the Armos Knight guards.
    If the player leaves this area, the Armos Knight will lose interest and go back to its spawn point.
    If the player is outside of this range from the spawn point, the Armos Knight will turn around and go back to its spawn point.
    00 - Defaults to range of 400.0 (instead of 0*100.0).
    FF - Defaults to range of 400.0 (instead of 255*100.0).
  params & 00FF0000 - Change switch behavior.
    00 - The switch at params & FF000000, if it's valid, causes the Armos Knight to permanently disappear once it's set.
    01 - If the switch at params & FF000000 is valid, the Armos Knight starts off inanimate, and the switch causes the Armos Knight to activate once it's set.
    02+ - The switch at params & FF000000 has no effect.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
  params & FF000000 - Switch index.
    Variable behavior - see params & 00FF0000 for details.
    FF - None. The Armos Knight is always normal, it never disappears or is inanimate.
amos2: Armos. (d_a_am2)
  params & 000000FF - Unused.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
    If the value located at 803E75AA,2 is not 0, this value will be forcibly changed to 01.
  params & 0000FF00 - This number multiplied by 100.0 is the range within it will notice you.
    00 - Defaults to range of 600.0 (instead of 0*100.0).
    FF - Defaults to range of 600.0 (instead of 255*100.0).
  params & 00FF0000 - Change switch behavior.
    00 - The switch at params & FF000000, if it's valid, causes the Armos to permanently disappear once it's set.
    01 - If the the switch at params & FF000000 is valid, the Armos starts off inanimate, and the switch causes the Armos to activate once it's set.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.

Gy: Gyorgs. (d_a_gy)
  Will not appear until you have the Boomerang.
  Will not appear if no Gyorg spawner (GyCtrl or GyCtrlB) is present.
  aux_params & FFFF - X rotation.
  aux_params_2 & FFFF - Z rotation.
GyCtrl, GyCtrlB: Gyorg spawners. (d_a_gy_ctrl)
  Will not appear until you have the Boomerang.
  params & 0000000F - Type.
    0 - Can follow you out of the sector. (GyCtrl)
      Note that once a single cross-sector Gyorg spawner exists, more cross-sector Gyorg spawners will not load in to prevent an infinite number of them being created by exiting and re-entering a sector that has one placed.
    1 - Stays within the sector it's placed in. (GyCtrlB)
      This type might despawn its Gyorgs when they get close to Big Octos, Rafts or Fishmen?
    F - Defaults to 0 instead.
  params & 000000F0 - Number of Gyorgs to spawn.
    F - Defaults to 1 instead.
  params & 0000FF00 - This number multiplied by 1000.0 is the range within it will notice KoRL and start spawning Gyorgs.
    FF - Defaults to a range of 10000.0 instead.
  params & FF000000 - Switch index. The spawner will not start creating Gyorgs until this switch is set.
    Unused in the vanilla game, but seems to work fine.
Stal: Stalfos. (d_a_st)
  params & 0000000F - Type.
    0 - Normal.
    1 - Underground.
    2 - Lying inside a horizontal coffin.
    3 - Standing inside a vertical coffin.
    4-D - Normal.
    E - Upper half of a Stalfos body only.
      Never placed directly in the vanilla game.
    F - Normal.
    Read at 8CCC in func daSt_Create(fopAc_ac_c *)
  params & 0000FF00 - When underground or in a coffin, this number multiplied by 10.0 is the range within it will notice the player and come out.
    This has no effect for types that are not underground/in a coffin.
    This also has no effect if switch index at params & FF000000 is valid.
    FF - Defaults to a range of 500.0 instead.
  params & 00FF0000 - Unused.
  params & FF000000 - Switch index. When underground or in a coffin, if this switch is valid the Stalfos will appear when it is set.
    FE and FF - Invalid. No switch is used to decide when to come out, and the distance to the player is used instead.
  aux_params_2 & 00FF - Disable spawn on death switch index.
    00 - Invalid, don't set a switch.
    If this is from 01-7F, set bit 0x400 in bitfield at entity+0x1C4??
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
    Read at 8CFC in func daSt_Create(fopAc_ac_c *)
bbaba: Boko Babas. (d_a_bo)
  params & 000000FF - Type.
    00 - Normal.
    01 - The lower part of the Boko Baba's death animation.
      This looks like a Baba Bud that quickly shrinks out of existence and is not usable.
    02 - The upper part of the Boko baba's death animation.
      This is the head and stem spinning through the air on defeat. When it lands, it turns into a Boko Stick.
    03-FE - Bugged.
      It's invisible, but it makes Boko Baba noises when you get close, and you can lock onto it.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
  params & 0000FF00 - Baba Bud type.
    00 - Does not leave a usable Baba Bud behind on death.
    01-FE - Does leave a usable Baba Bud behind on death.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
  When the Boko Baba dies, it creates the upper and lower parts of its death animation by creating Boko Baba entities that share this Boko Baba's params & FFFFFF00, but sets the lowest byte to 01 or 02 depending on which half of the death animation it is.
Sss: Dexivines. (d_a_sss)
  params & 000000FF - What SFX to play when coming out of the ground.
    00 - Play SFX 0x58F7.
    01 - Play SFX 0x58F8.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
    The difference between the two SFXs, if any, is extremely subtle.
  params & 0000FF00 - This number multiplied by 10.0 is used as a range within it notices the player and comes out of the ground.
    FF - Defaults to a range of 1000.0.
  params & 00FF0000 - Switch index. If this is valid the Dexivine will hide underground and not come out until the switch is set.
    This switch checking behavior is never used in the vanilla game.
    00 and FF - Invalid. Dexivine will come out of the ground when the player gets near.
      Also, this causes 230.0 to be added to the initial Y position of the hand part - meaning it will start off above ground when spawned, slowly sink below ground, then when the player gets near it comes back up.
Oq, Oqw: Octoroks. (d_a_oq)
  params & 000000FF - Type.
    00 - Freshwater Octorok.
    01 - Saltwater Octorok that shoots once the player is a certain range away from it.
    02 - Saltwater Octorok that appears close to the player (ignoring the position it was placed at). Also shoots the player after a certain delay.
      This type is used for the Saltwater Octorok spawned by the salvage object after you salvage a vase.
    03 - Saltwater Octorok spawner. Spawns type 05 Octoroks if the player is within a certain range of the spawner.
    04 - Saltwater Octorok that shoots the player after a certain delay.
    05 - Spawned Saltwater Octorok. Doesn't seem to appear when manually placed, must be created by type 03.
    06 - Rock shot by a Freshwater Octorok.
    FF - Defaults to 00 instead.
    Read at 4844 in func daOQ_Create(fopAc_ac_c *)

    00 - Freshwater Octorok that shoots rocks.
    01 - Freshwater Octorok that shoots bombs.
    02-FF - Defaults to 00.
    If the value located at 803E75AA,2 is not 0, this value will be XORed with 01 to toggle it.
  params & 00FF0000 - For type 3, this number multiplied by 1000.0 is the range within it will notice you and start spawning Octoroks.
    00 or FF - Defaults to a range of 80000.0.
LTag0, LTag1, LTagR0: Light ray. (d_a_tag_light)
